The code refers to the paper "Educational Disparities in Age-related Hearing Loss and Hearing Aid Use across Age, Gender, and European Region".

In this paper, we estimate the education-specific prevalence of self-reported HL and HA use and the Relative Index of Inequality (RII) therein.

This analysis uses data or information from the Harmonized Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) dataset and Codebook, Version F as of February 2023 developed by the Gateway to Global Aging Data. You can access the data here: https://g2aging.org/downloads.
